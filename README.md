# suggest-username

## Usage
- `gradlew bootRun` to start up the application, point your browser to http://localhost:8080 afterwards.
- `gradlew test` to run the unit tests.

## Room for improvement

- Adding suggestion rule interfaces instead of additional methods inside the SuggestionResult class.
- Also, that would separate the concerns a bit.
- Adding a delimiter for the suggestion label.
